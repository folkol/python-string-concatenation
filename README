Python String Concatenation

waymoot.org: Efficient String Concatenation in Python â€” An assessment of the performance of several methods

Introduction: Building long strings in the Python progamming language can sometimes result in very slow running code. In this article I investigate the computational performance of various string concatenation methods.

For this comparison I required a test problem that calls for the construction of very long strings out of a large number of segments. It should not do much other computation, so that the measured performance is dependent only on the string operation performance.

Aside: How determine the Sample Size?



- Python strings are immutable
- Adding two strings together creates a new one
